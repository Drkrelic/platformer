A personal project.
Tooling around with Data-Driven-Design.

Not much to see so far.  Still cleaning out clutter and getting this building on OSX and Linux.

NOTE:
    1. makefile is named "makefile.template" and should be renamed to "makefile" locally.
    2. Run "./configure" after copying "makefile.template" to "makefile".
    3. Now run "make".

TODO:
    * Make OSX project build a "main" that does the same thing as "main" for other platforms.
    * For OSX builds, copy built executable to project root.
    * Finish cleaning up all source files.
